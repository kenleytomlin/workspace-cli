description: Tests overwrite behavior

generates:
  # Create initial file
  - path: keep-me.txt
    content: "Original content"

  # Try to overwrite with overwrite: false (should NOT replace)
  - path: keep-me.txt
    content: "Replaced content"
    overwrite: false

  # Create another file that CAN be overwritten
  - path: replace-me.txt
    content: "First version"

  - path: replace-me.txt
    content: "Second version"
    overwrite: true

tests:
  - name: keep-me.txt exists
    assert_file_exists: keep-me.txt

  - name: keep-me.txt has original content (not overwritten)
    assert_file_contains:
      path: keep-me.txt
      contains: "Original content"

  - name: replace-me.txt exists
    assert_file_exists: replace-me.txt

  - name: replace-me.txt has second version (overwritten)
    assert_file_contains:
      path: replace-me.txt
      contains: "Second version"
