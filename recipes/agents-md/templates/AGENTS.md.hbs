# AGENTS.md

> This workspace uses [Workspace Recipes](https://github.com/agent-workspace/cli) for configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
# See available commands
workspace info

# Run tests (if configured)
workspace run test
```

## Project Structure

```
{{ project_name }}/
├── .bare/              # Git database (bare repo)
├── .git                # Pointer to .bare
├── .workspace/         # Workspace config & state
├── main/               # Main branch worktree
└── <worktree>/         # Additional worktrees
```

## Workspace Commands

```bash
# Manage recipes
workspace add <recipe>      # Add a recipe
workspace apply             # Apply pending recipes
workspace validate          # Validate configuration
workspace list              # List installed recipes
workspace info              # Show commands & status

# Manage worktrees
workspace worktree add <name>     # Create worktree
workspace worktree remove <name>  # Remove worktree
workspace worktree list           # List worktrees
```

## For AI Agents

### Navigation

- Each worktree is an isolated branch checkout
- Shared `.env` copied to each worktree
- Agent permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Commands

Before running commands, check what's available:

```bash
workspace info
```

Don't guess at commands — use the ones defined by recipes.

### Making Changes

1. Work in your assigned worktree
2. Run `workspace validate` before committing
3. Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
